A GPLv3 static ARM64 to x86 recompiler with a Switch, GBA and GNU/Linux ABI translation layer for Solaris, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and Android.

## Quick start

Each push to `main` that builds everywhere becomes a nightly in [scarletnx/nightly](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases), the newest 30
kept, with each open pull request's builds. The latest:
[ScarletNX-linux-x86_64.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-x86_64.AppImage) and
[ScarletNX-linux-aarch64.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-aarch64.AppImage) for Linux (`chmod +x` it first;
[ScarletNX-linux-ppc64le.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-ppc64le.AppImage),
[ScarletNX-linux-riscv64.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-riscv64.AppImage) and
[ScarletNX-linux-loongarch64.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-loongarch64.AppImage) are
cross-built for [PowerPC64 LE](docs/PPC64.md), [RISC-V and LoongArch](docs/RISCV-LOONGARCH.md), when their jobs built.
[ScarletNX-linux-ppc64.AppImage](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-linux-ppc64.AppImage), for
[PowerPC64 BE](docs/PPC64.md#big-endian-hosts), not yet run on a big-endian machine),
[ScarletNX-windows-x86_64.zip](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-windows-x86_64.zip) for Windows (run `bin\scarletnx.exe`)
and [ScarletNX-android-universal.apk](https://github.com/scarletnx/nightly/releases/latest/download/ScarletNX-android-universal.apk) ([Android](docs/ANDROID.md)).
Games need a Vulkan 1.3 driver.

Keys and games must be dumped from your own console. Started with no arguments, the program opens the
[launcher](docs/GUI.md). **Install Keys** installs your `prod.keys`. For NSPs, also put `title.keys` in
`~/.switch` (`%USERPROFILE%\.switch` on Windows). **Load Switch NSP/XCI/NRO** then picks a dump, extracts and
recompiles it and starts the game, which the **Games** tab lists from then on. See [Usage](docs/USAGE.md) for the
command line and [Folders](docs/USAGE.md#folders) for where games, saves and settings go.

The shared ARM64 recompiler lives under `src/common/`. Switch Horizon HLE
and Maxwell graphics live under `src/nx/`. The CPU-only Linux AArch64 runtime lives
under `src/gnuabi/` and builds without the Switch graphics or media dependencies:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/gnuabi -DSNX_BUILD_NX=OFF
cmake --build build/gnuabi
build/gnuabi/scarletnx-gnuabi -L /path/to/aarch64-sysroot ./test_aarch64
```

It runs static and dynamically linked programs, which start other processes, talk
through pipes and read and write files through a sysroot, as QEMU's `-L` gives one
(`linux/` of the data folder by default). See [Linux ABI execution and QEMU validation](docs/GNUABI.md)
for the sysroot, the JIT and AOT modes, supported syscalls, and current limits. The NX executable is
also installed as `scarletnx-switch`, and on Linux and macOS as `scarletnx-3ds` and `scarletnx-gnuabi`, the one
program running the driver its name says. Game Boy Advance ROMs run under the `scarletnx-agb` system type,
on the emulated AGB board being built under `src/agb/` (licensed under MPL-2.0), see [AGB board](docs/AGB.md).

The recompiler is also a library on its own, `libscarletnx-recompiler`: a program hands
it ARM64 or AArch32 code in memory and runs the result in its own process with its own
SVC handler, with no Switch runtime behind it. See
[The recompiler as a library](docs/LIBRARY.md).

Install the build tools first. On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake ninja-build clang llvm-dev nasm pkg-config \
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxfixes-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev
```
If your distribution provides `libsdl3-dev`, install it too. Otherwise CMake builds a pinned SDL3
using the X11 and audio development packages above. SDL2 is not a substitute for SDL3. You also
need a Vulkan 1.3 driver to run games. See [Build prerequisites](./docs/BUILD.md#prerequisites) for
Wayland, other systems, and the SDL3 troubleshooting steps.

Then build:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/scarletnx/ScarletNX
cd ScarletNX
cmake --preset default -B build && cmake --build build
```

For encrypted dumps, put `prod.keys` (and `title.keys`, for NSPs) in `~/.switch`, or pass them with
`--keys` and `--title-keys`. Decrypted DNSP/DXCI content needs no keys.
```bash
./build/scarletnx "Game.xci"  # extract, recompile, then play (also accepts NSP, DNSP and DXCI)
```
Run the same command again after an interruption. Completed extraction and recompilation are skipped,
but the game always starts anew. The driver keeps games, extractions and keys in its data folder,
`~/.local/share/scarletnx` on Linux ([Folders](./docs/USAGE.md#folders)). To run the steps separately, here in
folders of the current one:
```bash
./build/scarletnx -x "Game.xci" --out work/Game     # -> work/Game/{exefs,romfs}
./build/scarletnx -r work/Game Game --outdir games  # -> games/Game/Game
./build/scarletnx -rx "Game.xci"                   # prepare without playing (UNIX)
./build/scarletnx -Hs "Game.xci"                   # headless, wait for GDB (UNIX)
cd games/Game && ./Game
```

For an SDL3 menu, run `./build/scarletnx` with no arguments. Select a driver with arrow keys and
Enter or hover and click, then choose drag-and-drop or the paginated `games/` browser.
The GUI shows live driver/game
output and combined CPU/RAM usage. See [GUI launcher](docs/GUI.md).

The experimental `scarletnx-3ds` driver and **Load 3DS game** menu entry support
encrypted or decrypted application CIAs (`scarletnx-3ds -x game.cia`), cartridge
images (`game.cci`, `game.3ds`), bare NCCHs (`game.cxi`), a bundle or a z3ds
compressed game of any of them, an update partition
played as the update, and an independent
page-based memory controller. It runs the extracted titles through an experimental
**extract -> offline AOT -> native run** pipeline on 64-bit Linux and Windows, using an
explicit ARM11/checked-memory profile without changing shared A57 defaults.
The homebrew SuperTux draws its title and loading screens with a software port of
Azahar's PICA pipeline and plays its music through a port of Azahar's HLE DSP.
It is not playable yet: there is no input, the bottom screen is not shown, and parts of the OS are missing.
See the [3DS port](docs/3DS.md) for limits, build instructions and the parity roadmap.

The experimental `scarletnx-vita` driver and **Load Vita VPK** menu entry run PS Vita homebrew VPKs through the same
**extract -> offline AOT -> native run** pipeline, compiling code it missed at run time. It draws sceGxm's scenes
on Vulkan with a port of Vita3K's shader translator. The Lua Vita Tester draws its screen, reads input and plays sound.
See the [Vita driver](docs/VITA.md) for what it covers.

For more detailed information please see: [Build + run](./docs/BUILD.md). For the Android app (arm64 and x86_64),
see [Android](./docs/ANDROID.md). macOS and iOS build in CI. An iPhone prepares and runs a game by itself, and no game
runs on macOS yet: see [macOS and iOS](./docs/APPLE.md). Every document: [docs](./docs/README.md).

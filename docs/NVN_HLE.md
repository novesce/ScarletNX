# NVN reference

Switch games draw through NVN, NVIDIA's graphics API, which runs as guest code. It writes Maxwell pushbuffers,
submits them through nvdrv, and the GPU thread decodes them (`src/nx/gpu/gpu.c`, `maxwell/`) before calling the Vulkan
renderer (`vk/`). This page records what an investigation into handling NVN directly found about the SDK, and what it
decided. Facts marked as observations come from one or two titles and are not rules for every SDK version.

Titles referred to: Catherine: Full Body (USA v2.0, "Catherine"), Tears of the Kingdom (v1.0.0, "TotK"), Super Mario
Odyssey ("Odyssey") and Pokémon Scarlet ("Scarlet").

## Status and direction

**The Maxwell decoder renders, and any faster path builds on it: the MME is what to replace (below).** NVN command memory already
is a Maxwell pushbuffer, so a second front end that reinterprets NVN calls would decode the same words twice. A
disassembly study of the command-buffer functions found how little each call writes:

| Call | Words written |
| --- | --- |
| `nvnCommandBufferDrawArrays` | 4: one MME macro call, header `0xa0030e32`, then mode, first, count |
| `nvnCommandBufferDrawElements` | 6: header `0xa0050e38`, then mode, index address high and low, index type, count |
| `nvnCommandBufferBindTexture` | 4 or 5 (Catherine): an IMMD macro call `0x80000e0e \| table[stage] << 16` (a per-stage value from an SDK table), `0x8000068b` when the command buffer's byte `+0x6c` is set, then `0x200208e3`, `id*8 + 0x20`, handle |

Replacing command-buffer calls with host code therefore saves almost no guest CPU time. The hot path worth replacing
is the MME. A native implementation of a known macro would be chosen by a hash of the macro's uploaded code (slot
numbers are assigned by the SDK's macro upload, so a slot number alone identifies nothing), and an unknown hash keeps
the interpreter. `maxwell/mme.c` hashes a macro's code from its start to the end of the upload batch that wrote it
(NVN uploads each macro on its own), with Eden's hash, so Eden's table of macro hashes names the same code, and
`maxwell/mme_hle.c` has native versions of the ten macros TotK runs most (its slots 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 27, 30, 35, 37
and 38), of every macro in Eden's table, and of the busiest ones Catherine and Super Mario Odyssey interpret. They send
the same methods as the interpreter.
`tests/mme_hle.c` checks each against the interpreter running a macro written in the test. A macro's parameters are
pushbuffer words the GPU thread fetched before the call (`gpu.c`), so the indirect draws read their records and count
as the interpreter does: Eden's indirect path (the rasterizer drawing from the buffer's GPU address, with the shaders'
constant buffer reads of the base vertex, base instance and draw index replaced) has no counterpart here yet.
`mme_verify=1` (the `[Debug]` setting, or `--mme_verify=1`) runs both for every call of a known
macro and logs where they differ, `mme_hle=0` interprets everything, and the log names each macro's hash when it
is first called and counts native and interpreted calls every million. `nvn_control.c` decodes the arguments of two
macros and `nvn_command_gap.c` classifies what methods write, both checked against packets captured in their tests.

### Why semantic replay was abandoned

The investigation built about 14,000 lines of opt-in probes: a recorder of NVN calls, a replay of those calls on the
GPU thread, a second Vulkan renderer with its own image cache, and pixel comparisons against the Maxwell path. It
reached byte-exact intermediate targets in all four titles, but the approach could not become a renderer:

- **Not every command is in a recorded list.** Catherine's `nvnQueuePresentTexture` submits queue-side packets
  around the recorded command segments, and the tail sets the window-origin register (`0x4eb`) for the next
  submission. TotK submits 65 depth-writing macro 38 draws in GPFIFO entries that lie outside every recorded command
  span, inside the same `nvnQueueSubmitCommands`. A list of NVN calls cannot reproduce such a submit.
- **TotK inlines NVN.** `BeginRecording` is inlined in game code at `0x8714394` and `0x87164ac`, which write the same
  fields as the exported function at `0xd15a480`. Draws, constant-buffer binds and vertex ranges also appear in
  cursor gaps between exported calls. Even `--hook-direct-calls` sees none of this.
- **Post-submit observation is too late.** Replay ran after `QueueFlush` or the present. By then the 64×64 depth
  surface's address named a 1280×720 surface, generated texture handles had changed, the window-origin tail had run,
  and Maxwell had already rewritten guest memory the replay meant to read.
- **It duplicated the decoder.** To close each gap the probes grew a parser of Maxwell methods, MME argument
  decoders, register tracking and write provenance. That is `gpu.c`, `maxwell/` and `vk/` written a second time, and
  running both at once made coherence a problem of duplicate writes.

## What remains in the tree

### Mesh input bindings

Vertex streams retain their inclusive start/limit range when bound to Vulkan. The
bound size is supplied independently of the backing allocation, so a vertex or
instance outside the range cannot fetch a neighboring staged object. Attribute
tails that cross a record stride remain inside the guest binding's limit.

An empty binding keeps its actual vertex format over a zero-filled record. This
distinguishes an empty RGBA fetch (all four stored components are zero) from an
empty RGB fetch (the absent fourth component takes its format default of one).
Large relative offsets that lie beyond a binding also use the zero record,
without constructing a Vulkan offset past the allocation. Disabled attributes
retain their separate constant-attribute path. When pipeline robustness and
robustness2 are supported, graphics pipelines request strict vertex bounds;
storage/uniform buffers and compute pipelines keep their device defaults.

Synthetic GPU draws cover these limits, format defaults, noncontiguous position
pages, CPU updates, physical remapping and rebased relative offsets. These are
memory-fetch checks; they do not certify that a game's mesh data was correct
before binding it.

### Formatted surface stores

Formatted `SUST` image stores follow the descriptor's format for 2D images, 2D arrays and 3D textures. Float,
unsigned integer and signed integer stores declare an unknown SPIR-V image format with the matching scalar type.
Signed stores preserve register bits as signed values, with a separate key for both graphics and compute pipelines.
The renderer checks both the device's `shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat` feature and the view format's
storage-write support. This permits unsigned
formats such as RGBA8, R16 and RG32 rather than requiring every unsigned store to use R32_UINT. Loads and atomics
that require R32ui retain their explicit shader format. Vulkan's requirements are described in the
[storage image guide](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/storage_image_and_texel_buffers.html).

Storage views of mipmapped textures expose only the first level selected by the descriptor. Sampled views retain
the complete chain; the two view types have distinct cache keys and share their existing image. Writeback changes
only the selected level of each layer and preserves the other mip levels and padding. GPU swizzles merge partial
16-byte runs with the destination instead of overwriting bytes beyond the row width.

A storage descriptor smaller than a render target at the same address resolves to a writable texture with its own
guest layout, rather than a sampling-only crop snapshot. Its initial contents include the target's GPU writes.
Tests cover normalized RGBA8 and packed R11G11B10 float stores over wider targets, including surrounding bytes.
Bindless handles remain traceable when a local predicate is saved with `PSET` and restored with `ISETP`, or when an
equal integer compare is recomputed with unchanged operands. Changed guards and operands remain rejected.

`tests/vulkan_storage_formats.inc`, run by `vulkan_headless`, dispatches synthetic Maxwell programs against seven
signed and unsigned formats and five float formats in each of the three dimensions, through bound and bindless
handles, single-level images and selected mip levels. It compares exact guest bytes including neighboring texels,
layers, slices, mip data and padding, and checks that the complete sampled chain sees a selected-level write.
Type mismatches and the unformatted-write feature guard are checked too. `shader_direct_regressions` checks
declarations for fragment and compute stores and atomics, with nine signed store modules across vertex, fragment
and compute stages validated by `spirv-val`.
No game data is needed. Unsupported formats are skipped when the device cannot store to them.

Formatted and raw 32-bit `SULD` reads also support 2D array and 3D images. Their sampled image declarations retain
the array flag and dimension instead of treating every surface as 2D. `SUATOM` and `SURED` support 32-bit operations
on 3D R32_UINT images, including signed MIN/MAX comparisons. `tests/vulkan_storage_atomics.inc` checks 136 cases
with contending invocations, returned values, bound/bindless handles and selected mip levels. The additional 56
round-trips in `tests/vulkan_surface_loads.inc` check typed and raw reads, exact output and unchanged source bytes.
The shader regression suite also validates four volume atomic modules and eight array/volume load modules.

This does not provide complete NVN support. Atomic access through non-R32_UINT image formats remains outside this
path. A storage view selects one mip level; it does not expose all levels at once. The Maxwell decoder and
shader translator still execute the commands and programs NVN produces.

Known gaps in this path (not an exhaustive inventory of NVN):

| Operation | Current limit |
| --- | --- |
| Surface compare-and-swap, wrapping INC/DEC and 64-bit atomics | Not translated |
| Raw surface loads wider than 32 bits and raw surface stores | Not translated |
| One-dimensional non-buffer surface operations | Not translated |
| Multisample textures in compute | Dispatch is skipped |
| Texture handles the shader tracker cannot resolve | Shader is rejected; affected draws or dispatches are skipped |

Passing image-operation tests does not verify all games' geometry, lighting, synchronization or presentation.

### GPU compatibility coverage

Shader instruction invalidation reaches the Vulkan shader address caches from the 3D engine's `0x87` and `0x369`
methods and the compute engine's `0x87` and `0x5a6` methods. Bit 0 advances a shader generation independent of the
memory epoch. The next lookup reloads code, while content-addressed modules remain reusable. This does not expire
texture caches or force a host wait. Repeated invalidations flush any held draw before advancing the generation.
The method encodings are documented in NVIDIA's public [3D class](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/classes/3d/clb197.h)
and [compute class](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/classes/compute/clb1c0.h) headers.

| File | What it is | Built into |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/nx/gpu/nvn_trace.c` | `nvn_trace=1` inventory of resolved and called NVN functions | the runtime |
| `tests/support/nvn_control.c` | decoders for the 12-word macro 38 indexed draw and the macro 12 program bind | `tests/nvn_control.c` |
| `tests/support/nvn_command_gap.c` | classifier of Maxwell method write effects in a span of command words | `tests/nvn_command_gap.c` |

Every `SNX_NVN_*` variable is gone: these are `[Debug]` settings now. `gpu_trace_target=address[:bytes]` (`vk/render.c`) logs the clears and
draws that write a render target starting in that range, and replaced the older GPU trace variables.

## Observing NVN calls

The SDK exports `nvnBootstrapLoader`, which returns a guest function pointer for an NVN function name. With
`nvn_trace=1`, `nvn_trace.c` replaces that function's entry in the recompiler's dispatch table `g_disp`, then the
entry of the `nvnDeviceGetProcAddress` pointer it returns, then the entry of every address either of them resolves. The
wrappers count calls and always call the original, so rendering is unchanged.

| Log line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `nvn: NAME -> ADDRESS` | a name resolved through either loader |
| `nvn-submit: queue=... count=... lists=... first=...` | an `nvnQueueSubmitCommands` call and its first list handle |
| `nvn-nvnQueue...: GPFIFO submissions during call=N` | GPFIFO submissions, by any thread, while one queue call ran (`SubmitCommands`, `Flush`, `FenceSync`, `PresentTexture`, `WaitSync`) |
| `nvn-used: NAME COUNT` | at exit, the calls to each address that was called |
| `nvn: N resolved addresses, M called` | at exit, the totals |

Limits:

- The wrappers see calls through `g_disp`, which is how NVN function pointers are called. A statically resolved
  branch calls its generated C function directly and is only seen in a module recompiled with
  `--hook-direct-calls`. Counts are lower bounds otherwise.
- Names that fold to one address share a counter, labeled with the first name resolved there.
- Functions the game inlines are never seen (see the TotK example above).
- A title that resolves NVN some other way than `nvnBootstrapLoader` needs another discovery path.

Boot samples resolve about 470 (Catherine) and 530 (TotK) names and call about a third of them. The frequently called
shared functions are buffer-address and texture-handle lookups, texture binds, blend and vertex state, and
command-buffer operations. Counts vary between runs with the same frame limit.

## Queue and submission observations

| Queue call | Catherine | TotK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nvnQueueSubmitCommands` | no GPFIFO submission | no GPFIFO submission |
| `nvnQueueFenceSync` | none | none |
| `nvnQueueWaitSync` | none | not recorded |
| `nvnQueueFlush` | not recorded | one per call |
| `nvnQueuePresentTexture` | one per call | one per call |

These are per-call observations, not a guarantee of where the SDK flushes. The queue stages list handles, then walks a
tagged control stream of GPU work and sync operations, so submission is deferred to a flush or a present.

Catherine's first present issues one six-entry GPFIFO submission: two queue packets, the two recorded command
segments, then a 58-word queue tail that writes the window origin. The queue packets come from a separate queue-side
backing, not from the command pool the game supplied. The recorded segments' GPU addresses follow from the command
buffer's chunk fields (next section).

## Command buffer layout (Catherine USA v2.0 and TotK v1.0.0 SDK observations)

`NVNcommandBuffer` fields, from disassembly of the two SDKs:

| Field | Catherine | TotK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| device | `+0x00` | `+0x60` |
| memory callback, userdata | `+0x08`, `+0x10` | `+0x68`, `+0x70` |
| command cursor | `+0x18` | `+0x00` |
| command limit | `+0x20` | `+0x08` |
| chunk start | `+0x28` | `+0x40` |
| control cursor | `+0x30` | `+0x20` |
| control limit | `+0x38` | `+0x28` |
| control stream start | `+0x40` | `+0x48` |
| current range-record header | `+0x48` | `+0x50` |
| chunk CPU base | `+0x50` | `+0x30` |
| chunk GPU base | `+0x60` | `+0x58` |
| recording flag (byte) | `+0x68` | `+0x11` |
| space check enabled, BindTexture's `0x68b` word (bytes) | `+0x6d`, `+0x6c` | not observed |
| reserve margin in words | `+0x70` (u32) | `+0x16` (u8) |

The GPU address of a cursor is chunk GPU base + (cursor - chunk CPU base). TotK caps each range at `0x7ffffc` bytes.

Command functions are all inlined copies with no shared reserve helper. Each checks whether cursor + n*4 exceeds the
limit (Catherine checks only when the command buffer's byte `+0x6d` is set) and if so calls a slow path (Catherine `0xd141f20`, TotK `0xd15a754`). The slow path calls the memory callback
(event 0 for command memory, 1 for control memory), expects it to call `AddCommandMemory` or `AddControlMemory`, and
asserts if the space is still short.

The control stream:

- `BeginRecording` writes `{0xffffffffffffff01, 0}`.
- A range record is a header qword (low dword type 3, high dword entry count) followed by 24-byte entries
  `{u64 gpu_va, u64 cpu_va, u32 nwords, u8 flags}`, with flags 1 for mergeable and 3 for normal. A range contiguous
  with the previous one merges by adding to its `nwords`.
- `EndRecording` writes a type-2 terminator and returns control start + 0x10 as the command handle.
- Draws and binds do not touch the control stream. Only flushes (`AddCommandMemory`, `EndRecording`) and compute-stage
  binds (16-byte control items) do. A compute-stage (stage 5) `BindTexture` writes a control item instead of methods.

| Function | Catherine | TotK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nvnCommandBufferInitialize` | `0xd141860` | `0xd15a0a0` |
| `nvnCommandBufferAddCommandMemory` | `0xd141920` | `0xd15a140` |
| `nvnCommandBufferAddControlMemory` | `0xd141af0` | `0xd15a320` |
| `nvnCommandBufferBeginRecording` | `0xd141c40` | `0xd15a480` |
| `nvnCommandBufferEndRecording` | `0xd141cf0` | `0xd15a530` |
| `nvnCommandBufferDrawArrays` | `0xd163b00` | `0xd183880` |
| `nvnCommandBufferDrawElements` | `0xd163b80` | `0xd1838f0` |
| `nvnCommandBufferBindTexture` | `0xd1627c0` | `0xd181680` |

`nvnDeviceGetTextureHandle` is `orr w8,w1,w2,lsl #20; sxtw x8,w8; orr x0,x8,#0x100000000; ret` in both (TotK
`0xd165530`): the texture ID in the low 20 bits, the sampler ID in the next 12, and bit 32 set.

## Other SDK object layouts

Layouts differ between SDK versions, so a getter is safer than an offset. TotK exports builder and view getters
(`nvnMemoryPoolBuilderGet*`, `nvnTextureBuilderGet*`, `nvnTextureViewGet*`). Pure getters such as
`nvnTextureGetStorageSize`, `GetTextureAddress`, `GetStride` and `GetStorageClass` were also called successfully on a
copy of the CPU state after `nvnTextureInitialize`. The layouts seen:

- **Memory pool builder:** newer SDKs keep flags, storage and size at `+4`, `+16`, `+24`. Odyssey's older SDK keeps
  storage, size and flags at `+8`, `+16`, `+24`.
- **Texture builder:** Odyssey's older layout keeps the pool pointer and storage offset eight bytes earlier than the
  newer one. Odyssey also passes copies of initialized texture and sampler objects to `SetRenderTargets` and the
  register calls, so object identity cannot be keyed on the pointer.
- **Texture view:** TotK's `TextureViewSetDefaults` clears 16 bytes and packs selection and override flags into it
  (six selection flags, target, format, swizzle with identity `2,3,4,5`, depth mode). Catherine's clears 36 bytes with
  separate flag and value fields. Odyssey also uses 36 bytes, with a different constructor and the target at `+32`.
- **Programs:** `nvnProgramSetShaders` passes 16-byte (code, control) pairs. `SetShadersExt` passes 24-byte entries,
  which the SDK splits into those pairs plus an array of third words. Reading the plain pairs as 24-byte entries
  shifts every reference after the first.
- **Texture handle:** low 20 bits texture ID, next 12 bits sampler ID. `RegisterTexture` writes a 32-byte TIC and
  `RegisterSampler` a 32-byte TSC into the pool's memory. `RegisterImage` writes an image descriptor into the texture
  pool. Neither Catherine nor TotK exposed a GPU base for the descriptor pools, so the descriptors were read through
  the pool's CPU backing.
- **Vertex state (the same in Catherine and TotK):** an attribute is one 32-bit word with an enable bit, a 5-bit
  stream index, a 14-bit byte offset and a 10-bit format. A stream is two 32-bit words, stride and divisor.
- **Samplers:** the builder layouts differ between Catherine and TotK, so only explicit setter arguments are reliable.
- **`BindProgram`** applies to a stage mask. A later partial bind replaces only its stages.

`ClearColor` is not a no-op when repeated: each call advances the cursor by 48 bytes. A clear to an integer target
passes float bits (Scarlet passes `0x3f800000`), which reach the Maxwell clear registers unchanged.

## Shader blobs

| Kind | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| Graphics | a 0x30-byte wrapper with magic `0x12345678`, then the Maxwell shader program header (SPH) and instructions |
| Bare shader file | magic `0x19866891` at the start of a file one game ships, with its SPH at `0xB50` and no wrapper |
| Compute | magic `0x12345679` with the declared code size at `+4`, 0x100 bytes before the code. The QMD's program address is the code, so it is the NVN candidate + 0x100. Local workgroup size and shared memory come from the NVN control object |

- **VertexA and VertexB:** NVN dual vertex programs put the position in VertexA (slot 0) and the varyings in VertexB.
  In Catherine, a program reference named only VertexA, and VertexB was at the next 0x200-byte code slot. Using
  VertexA alone produced alpha zero.
- **Embedded CBUF 1:** compiler-generated constant bank 1 sits in the code section after the program. A header size of
  `0x190` put it at offset `0x200`, and `0x210` at `0x300`. Both matched the Maxwell bank 1 bindings.
  [deko3d's `dk_shader.cpp`](https://github.com/devkitPro/deko3d/blob/master/source/dk_shader.cpp) does the same. For
  compute, the offset comes from the control metadata.
- **Odyssey** has blobs with a zero size field and a valid magic and SPH. Their bank 1 offset was not established.

## Constant buffer banks

| Bank | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | SDK-generated. Base vertex and base instance at `0x640` and `0x644`. Storage buffer descriptors (TotK fragment at `0x550`, compute at `0x310`). TotK bound bank 0 once for all five graphics stages, with an ordinary bind before its first submission (an observation) |
| 1 | embedded in the shader blob (above) |
| 2 | generated texture handles at word `8 + 2*slot`, image handles at word `72 + 2*slot`. Compute texture slot 0 is word 8 in TotK |
| 3 + N | application uniform slot N, graphics and compute alike |

The bank 2 layout matches `BindTexture`'s `id*8 + 0x20` byte offset. Maxwell rounds uniform binding sizes up to 256
bytes. Binding NVN uniform slots to identically numbered banks is wrong. The generated bank's live contents change
during a submission, so a value read after the GPU ran can differ from the one a draw used.

## Maxwell methods and macros observed

Method numbers are 3D engine (subchannel 0) word offsets, and macro calls are methods `0xe00 + 2*index`.

| Method | Use seen in NVN command memory |
| --- | --- |
| `0x004`-`0x007` | puller semaphore address, payload and operation (release writes memory, acquire reads) |
| `0x3e0`, `0x68b` | written with zero (cache flush and no-op forms, no memory effect) |
| `0x4eb` | window origin. Catherine's queue tail changes it from 0 to `0x10` after the first submission |
| `0x5f2`, `0x5f6` | index buffer address (two words) and index type, before macro 38 |
| `0x6c0`-`0x6c3` | query address, sequence and report operation |
| `0x701`, `0x702`, `0x7c0`, `0x7c1` | vertex stream 0 start address and inclusive end |
| `0x8e0`-`0x8e3` | constant buffer size, address and write offset |
| `0x8e4`-`0x8f3` | constant buffer data |
| `0x904 + 8*stage` | constant buffer bank bind (`0x904` vertex, `0x924` fragment) |

| Macro | Method | Observed meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | `0xe0e` | IMMD call with the shader stage, at the start of `BindTexture`: selects the stage's constant buffer (size from scratch `0xd2f + stage`, address from `0xd2a + stage`) for the handle written next |
| 8 | `0xe10` | blend enables of the eight render targets from bits 8-15 of its argument, after a zero to `0x671` |
| 9 | `0xe12` | the eight render targets' color masks (`0x680`-`0x687`), two 13-bit halves per argument |
| 12 | `0xe18` | program bind, five arguments. Selector 1 writes VertexB's code offset, 5 the fragment's, and the third argument is the offset (TotK MME trace) |
| 16 | `0xe20` | sets a constant buffer write offset in words: `0x154` before a storage descriptor upload of three `0x8e4` words landed at bank 0 + `0x550`. In TotK it began at word `0xfe` of the uploaded MME program |
| 25 | `0xe32` | `DrawArrays` (mode, first, count) |
| 27, 37 | `0xe36`, `0xe4a` | instanced draw: topology, vertex count, instance count (masked by scratch `0xd1b`), first vertex, base instance. 37 also writes the base instance into the bound constant buffer at `0x644` |
| 30 | `0xe3c` | instanced indexed draw, TotK's busiest macro: topology, index count, instance count (masked by `0xd1b`), first index, base vertex, base instance |
| 35 | `0xe46` | writes scratch `0xd38`-`0xd39`, then `0x0d8`-`0x0d9`, from two arguments and scratch `0xd3a` |
| 28 | `0xe38` | `DrawElements` (mode, index address high and low, index type, count) |
| 38 | `0xe4c` | the 12-word indexed draw in TotK secondary lists: IMMD `0xe20` (value `0x190`, the base vertex word), index type, index address, then six arguments. Packet word 10 (the fifth argument) is the base vertex |

Slot numbers are TotK's and those written by the studied functions. Another title's upload can number them
differently. Register writes made inside a macro are not visible in the pushbuffer, so shader and constant buffer
state cannot be inferred from direct writes alone.

## NVN formats

Values from the [reconstructed NVN header](https://code.botw.link/uking/uking/lib/NintendoSDK/include/nvn/nvn.h.html),
each confirmed in at least one title:

| NVN | Format | Vulkan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x03` | R8 UINT | `R8_UINT` |
| `0x06` | R16 | `R16_UNORM` |
| `0x0a` | R32F | `R32_SFLOAT` |
| `0x0f` | RG8 UINT | `R8G8_UINT` |
| `0x11` | RG16F | `R16G16_SFLOAT` |
| `0x12` | RG16 | `R16G16_UNORM` |
| `0x13` | RG16 SNORM | `R16G16_SNORM` |
| `0x25` | RGBA8 | `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` |
| `0x26` | RGBA8 SNORM | `R8G8B8A8_SNORM` |
| `0x27` | RGBA8 UINT | `R8G8B8A8_UINT` |
| `0x29` | RGBA16F | `R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT` |
| `0x2e` | RGBA32F | `R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT` |
| `0x38` | RGBA8 sRGB | `R8G8B8A8_SRGB` |
| `0x3d` | RGB10A2 | `A2B10G10R10_UNORM_PACK32` |
| `0x3f` | R11G11B10F | `B10G11R11_UFLOAT_PACK32` |

Also seen, without their enum values recorded: R8, RG8, R16F, D16, D32F, D24S8, BC1, BC2, BC3 and BC4. An sRGB view of
RGBA8 storage (Odyssey) is a format reinterpretation of one image, not a second image.

## Per-device and per-submission state

- **Depth mode** belongs to the device, not the draw: draws use the device's `[0, 1]` or `[-1, 1]` mapping.
- **Window origin** cannot come from the device getter. Catherine's getter reports upper left from startup while the
  register changes between the first and second submission, written by the queue tail. Its value matters at the
  command segment's position in the submission.
- **User clip enables** are a register the vertex shader translation depends on. TotK enabled all eight (`0xff`) on
  its cubemap draws, and two other games on every draw. The vertex programs a game ships, translated before its
  draws use them (`prepare_shaders`), take that value, so their keys match those draws.
- **Render conditions:** `SetRenderEnableConditional` compares query values that puller releases inside the same list
  change between clears. Only an ordered decode of the list can say whether a clear runs. Reading guest memory after
  the list cannot.
- **Unbound attributes:** TotK enables attributes with no bound stream. The Maxwell renderer supplies `(0,0,0,1)`, and
  any NVN path has to match it.

## Emulator fixes kept from the investigation

| Fix | Where |
| --- | --- |
| A render-target alias of an 8×8 cubemap mip is padded to a 16×8 surface (64-byte GOB rows). The importer accepts that shape and copies the logical extent | `vk/texture.c` `tex_take_drawn` |
| Depth-only D16 and D32F textures import from render targets through the depth aspect | `vk/texture.c` |
| Four-byte packed depth/stencil uploads: G24R8 (`0x0e`) and Z24S8 (`0x29`) keep stencil in the low byte, X8Z24 (`0x2a`) and S8Z24 (`0x2b`) depth in the low 24 bits | `vk/texture.c` |
| A BRX resolves its jump table when the LDC is up to 64 instructions back, with only a short list of instructions that don't write the index register in between and no control flow before it. TotK has the LDC at instruction 93 and the BRX at 125 | `shader/shader.c` `brx_far_ldc` |
| Compute code is bounded by the NVN header's declared size (magic `0x12345679` at code - 0x100), so an unresolved BRX cannot scan into neighboring programs | `vk/compute.c` |
| Storage results are read back from host-cached memory | `vk/buffer.c`, `vk/cmd.c` |

## Techniques and pitfalls

Techniques that worked:

- **Verify a replaced function against the original.** Run the SDK function on a copy of the CPU state and compare
  every register with the replacement's result.
- **Byte-compare a GPFIFO entry with command memory** to find which list or pool it came from. Translate GPU addresses
  to CPU addresses before concluding two ranges are separate, since they live in different address spaces.
- **Read back at the operation, not at the present.** A readback at the present describes the frame's last use of an
  address, not the operation in question.
- **Prove coverage with a sentinel.** Clear to an unusual value per component, draw, and accept a target as fully
  written only if every component of every pixel changed.
- **Trace the executed MME** to learn a macro's arguments, rather than guessing from the call site.
- **`gpu_trace_target`** narrows a wrong target to the clears and draws that wrote it.

Pitfalls:

- Screenshot hashes are not deterministic across unmodified fixed-frame runs. Compare readbacks of a chosen target.
- Post-submit comparisons mislead. Surfaces are reused at the same address within a submission (TotK clears and
  reuses one depth surface for each cube face), so a later readback describes a different operation.
- Two uncovered images both read back as zero and compare equal. Check coverage before calling a comparison a match.
- A probe that submits or finishes the queue changes what it measures. A readback after a draw once masked a missing
  descriptor, and a queue finish advanced the frame so that draws were skipped and the result looked better.
- Bounded logs answer "maybe" when they wrap. The Maxwell write log (`maxwell3d.c`, 1,024 entries) answered "assume
  dirty" for any range over 1 MiB once constant buffer updates wrapped it, every frame, and the probes treated that
  as a real write. Writes are kept per page now (`gpu/maxwell/write_pages.c`), but a write of the same data still
  counts as a write.
- A zero texture handle (Scarlet binds many) may be an unused slot or a shader-visible null descriptor. Decide from
  the shader's texture use, not from the bind.
- Run counts vary with timing even at the same frame limit. Treat them as samples, not coverage.

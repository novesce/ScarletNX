# ScarletNX's own C is written to ISO C's rules, and two flags would hide code that breaks them:
# - -fno-strict-aliasing: an object is accessed through its own type, a character type, or memcpy
#   (common/utilities/endian.h for guest and wire bytes), and builds with Clang's default strict aliasing;
# - -fwrapv (and -fno-strict-overflow, which implies it): signed arithmetic doesn't overflow. Arithmetic that wraps is
#   done in unsigned types and converted back, a product that can overflow gets a wider intermediate.
# The configure stops on either anywhere it reaches that code: the global flags, and every target, source file and
# directory defined from this project's source tree. Third-party packages (CPM's, under .cache/cpm or the build tree)
# keep their own flags. The LLVM backend's runtime library, which is compiled by a custom command, checks its own flags
# (src/common/cpu/recompiler/llvm/).
#
# SNX_TRAPV builds that same code, and the runtime library, with -ftrapv and a trap on a left shift of a negative value
# (-fsanitize=shift-base in trap mode, which -ftrapv doesn't cover and -fwrapv also defined): a signed overflow left in
# it stops the program there (an illegal instruction) instead of giving whatever the optimizer made of it. Neither needs
# a sanitizer runtime, so the game modules' library takes them too. A build to find them with (the tests, a game run),
# never one to ship. -fsanitize=undefined (SNX_TEST_SANITIZERS) says where.

/* The JIT's loader: the LLVM backend's relocatable objects (snx_ir_object's, the runtime library's) placed in this
   process's memory and linked there, where the AOT path links them into a module file for dlopen (link_elf.c,
   link_coff.c). ELF objects are read and relocated by elf_object.c, as link_elf.c reads and relocates them, and
   Windows' COFF objects by code_loader_coff.c.

   A loader owns one code arena: address space reserved once and given back only when the loader is freed. It is at
   most 2 GiB, so a 32-bit displacement reaches from any byte of it to any other: code loaded later calls the runtime
   library loaded first directly. The arena is three regions, each filled front to back with the loads packed one
   after another (a load's code from a new cache line, its other parts as their sections align):
     [code, stubs: read-execute] [read-only data, GOT: read-only] [data, bss: read-write]
   The first two are shared memory mapped twice: the region in the arena, which code runs from and which never
   becomes writable, and a read-write view elsewhere that the loader writes through, with every address computed for
   the arena. So a load goes next to code other threads are running, on the same pages, with no page writable and
   executable in one view (W^X) and no protection change per load (macOS has one view of them: below). The data region
   is private memory, made read-write a page at a time as loads reach it.

   A load's symbols resolve to the load's own definitions first, then to the loader's table: the globals of earlier
   loads and the names given to snx_code_define (the runtime's functions and data, anywhere in the address space). A
   call to a table symbol out of its displacement's reach (x86-64's 2 GiB, AArch64's 128 MiB) goes through a stub in
   the load, and a GOT reference gets a slot in the load's read-only GOT, which holds the full address.

   Threads: one call at a time per loader, which the caller serializes. Code from earlier loads keeps running during a
   load, which writes only bytes no earlier load uses, and an address comes out of snx_code_load only once its code is
   written and the instruction cache flushed: the caller can hand it to other threads (with release ordering) as is.
   x86-64 keeps instruction fetch coherent with stores from every core, checked on physical addresses (Intel SDM vol.
   3A, 11.6), so through the other view too, and no thread can jump to the new bytes before it loads their address.
   AArch64 needs more: the instruction cache is invalidated at the executable view's addresses, and every core of the
   process synchronizes its instruction stream (membarrier's PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE) before the address goes out,
   since a core may have fetched those bytes before they were written. An AArch64 Linux kernel without it (before
   4.16) gets no loader. XNU has no membarrier: on macOS each load stops every other thread of the process off its core
   (thread_get_state), and a thread comes back through a context switch, which XNU synchronizes.

   x86-64 and AArch64 ELF hosts with memfd_create (Linux) or SHM_ANON (FreeBSD), and x86-64 Windows 10 (1803) and
   later, whose objects are COFF. There the views are a pagefile-backed section (CreateFileMapping, with
   PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE as its maximum protection) mapped twice: with MapViewOfFile3 into a placeholder cut out of the
   arena's reservation (VirtualAlloc2 with MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER, VirtualFree with MEM_PRESERVE_PLACEHOLDER), and
   read-write anywhere. A COFF load's function table (.pdata) is registered with RtlAddFunctionTable, the arena's start
   its image base, so exceptions and longjmp unwind through JIT code as through a module's.

   PowerPC64 (ELFv1 and ELFv2) loads keep one TOC for the whole arena in r2, as the AOT linker's module keeps one
   (link_elf.c), so guest code jumps from one load into another with r2 as it is. Loaded code may call nothing outside
   the arena directly: the runtime's functions have a TOC of their own, which only pointer calls (RtAPI) switch to.
   The runtime JIT's arena shares the TOC of the AOT module its units call and jump into (snx_code_loader_new_toc):
   the arena is placed within 32-bit reach of the module's TOC, which every load keeps in r2 instead, so a guest's
   jump between the module and a load, either way, leaves r2 as the code it reaches wants it.

   macOS on Apple silicon loads ELF objects too, which the IR backend writes there with Darwin's calling convention
   (snx_ir_new_jit). Memory becomes executable there only as MAP_JIT memory, which can't be shared or placed: the code
   and read-only data are one MAP_JIT mapping, which each thread sees either writable or executable
   (pthread_jit_write_protect_np). The loading thread sees it writable while it writes a load, every other thread
   executable, so no thread can write and run it at once, and nothing loaded may run on the loading thread during
   snx_code_load (the resolver included). Not iOS, where an app may not make memory executable */

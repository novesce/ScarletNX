   the entry that changed. An object is a load's relocatable object with the loaded sections' sh_addr set to where the
   load put them (code_loader.c writes them into the copy), so GDB's reader takes their symbols at those addresses (an
   ET_REL symbol is its section's address plus st_value) and applies the object's relocations to .eh_frame itself */

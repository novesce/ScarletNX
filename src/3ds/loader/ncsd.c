/* A cartridge image, a CCI or a .3ds, as a console dump holds one: an NCSD header at 0, its magic at 0x100, and a
   table of eight partitions, each described by an offset and a size in media units of 0x200 bytes. The game is
   partition 0 (Azahar's NCSDContentIndex::Main; 1 is the manual, 2 a DLP child, 6 and 7 the updates), and it holds
   an NCCH exactly as a CIA's boot content does, so the loader reads that partition's NCCH where it lies and checks
   it as it checks any other.

   Azahar reads partition 0's NCCH and re-reads its header; the update is taken by its title ID here, which is the
   base game's with the update title's high bits (0x0004000e00000000, Azahar's UPDATE_TID_HIGH), so a New 3DS update
   in partition 6 and one in partition 7 are both found. A cartridge's update NCCH is then the game's ExHeader and
   code, as Azahar's overlay_ncch is, while the title ID stays the base NCCH's, as its ReadProgramId. */
